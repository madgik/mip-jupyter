## What production users see

```text
/home/jovyan/work/
  Welcome.ipynb             # Opens by default
  examples/
  docs/                     # from docs/user/
  scratch/
```

## What production users do not see

- `python-client/` source tree
- Dockerfiles and Hub configuration
- `docs/llm/` agent wiki (`/opt/mip-agent-docs/`)
- `mip_jupyter_dev/` tooling
- Repository CI files

## Deployment

Orchestration and environment configuration: **`mip/deployment`**. See [`operators.md`](operators.md).

## Legacy root paths

Root-level `Dockerfile.jupyter` and `Dockerfile.jupyterhub` were moved to `docker/singleuser/` and `docker/hub/`. Update build scripts and CI to use the new paths.
